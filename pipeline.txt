need to string all of these into a pipeline at some point. 
Currently here is the order:
1. align ATAC fastq files with bowtie from the bowtie scripts folder 
2. filter the bam files (*may need to remove temp files)
3. convert bamm files to tagalign (to gz)
4. pool tagAlign files 
5. call peaks 

*currently the pipeline does not shift tagalign files..? I could do this but we would really only need it for footprinting
